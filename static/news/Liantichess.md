Hello guys,

It seems that liantichess got a lot more traffic than usual today :)

I really appreciate everyone who offered to help, donated, reported a bug or made me aware of some possible improvements. I definitely see and hear every single message and I am really happy to get such a positive feedback for this project. I know the site has many bugs, some more severe than others, some bugs are just not yet implemented features and some bugs might be even game breaking. I ask for your patience while I'm fixing these bugs. Believe me when I say, I want them fixed more than anyone and I will try my best to get them fixed as soon as possible. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Thank you for using liantichess
